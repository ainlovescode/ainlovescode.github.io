It was the 2021 Results Release

Your heart was pounding in your ears as you watched your Principal walk on stage. You could almost hear the blood rushing in your veins, desperately hoping for the best.

Anyone would be nervous getting their national examination results, but unlike other years, you and many other graduates sitting around you were and still are living through a global pandemic.

Let's confirm a few things. Which national exam did you do last year?

    That's great! I hope you get into the university you want.

And what was it like for you studying for the exams during a pandemic?

  #I usually studied in school. My parents could not afford tuition, and it can be really distracting to study at home.
    I've been there. The classroom are really quiet after school too!
  #I usually studied at home. I don't have tuition, and I need to help do the chores and take care of my siblings.
    It can't be easy - juggling school and family commitments.
  #I usually studied at home. I have tuition a few times a week, so at least I can ask my tutor any questions I have.
    It's always great to get some extra help!
  #I usually studied at home. My parents let me study in my room alone, and it really helps me focus!
    Having supportive parents at home really helps with focusing on school, doesn't it?
